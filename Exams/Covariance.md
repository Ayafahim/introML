First you can clearly see that it is the first matrix since the plot for x1,x2 should have a positive diagonal therefore it is the first matrix. Now the correlation between x1 and x2 is:
$$
corr(x_1,x_2) = \frac{cov(x_1,x_2)}{\sqrt{var(x_1) \times var(x_2)}}
$$
Where $cov(x_1,x_2)$ = 0.56 & the variances are in the diagonal so $var(x_1) = 0.5, var(x_2) = 1.5$
$$
corr(x_1,x_2) = \frac{0.56}{0.5 \times 1.5 } = 0.647
$$
