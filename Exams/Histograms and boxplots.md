## F23, Q2) We consider the histograms of the four attributes in Figure 2. Match the histograms to the attributes by using the information regarding the distribution of the points from Figure 1. Which one of the following statements is correct?

### Solution
If you look at the diagonals you can see where the data lies e.g.
$(x_2,x_2)$ you can see the data starts after -2 and you can see that in histogram 4 it is the same.

You can also see in the figure for the variances that the densities for $x_3$ are in the middle which also indicates the same for the histogram so histogram 1 matches.

So option B

### Solution 

Mean er omkring 50% percentile, estimeret.
Variance - rang/3, rangen er hvor meget der er mellem det interval hvor 99% af dataene ligger. 

Fx.
for x1 fra ca. -7 til 0 ligger det meste data og der er fra -7 til 0 = 7, så er rangen 7/3 = 2.33 så variancen er ca 2.33

## S19, Q1 ) The main dataset used in this exam is the travel review dataset1 described in Table 1. In Figure 1 is shown a scatter plot of the two attributes x2 and x9 from the travel review dataset and in Figure 2 boxplots of the attributes x2, x7, x8, x9 (not in that order). Which one of the following statements is true?

## solution
D. Attribute x2 corresponds to boxplot 2 and x9 corresponds to boxplot 1. Honestly just look at where the data goes you can see that for boxplot 2 the data is very spread but also that it stretches all the way from 0 - 3 and then one outlier after 3.5 on the x-axis, which matches boxblot 2. Also notice the median is around same place as half of the data in the scatter plot on x-axis. Same goes for y-axis

Again look at where data reaches. The y-axis its from around 2.2-3.6, boxplot 1 is the only one that matches that.
