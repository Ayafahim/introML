### Solution
If you look at the diagonals you can see where the data lies e.g.
$(x_2,x_2)$ you can see the data starts after -2 and you can see that in histogram 4 it is the same.

You can also see in the figure for the variances that the densities for $x_3$ are in the middle which also indicates the same for the histogram so histogram 1 matches.

So option B
