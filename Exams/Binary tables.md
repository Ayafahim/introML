### Understanding A-priori Algorithm:

The **A-priori Algorithm** is a popular method used in data mining to identify frequent itemsets (combinations of items) and derive association rules from a database of transactions. Each item in a transaction is treated as a binary feature, either present (1) or absent (0).

### Key Concepts:

1. **Support**: This measures how frequently an itemset appears in the dataset. An itemset must meet a minimum support threshold to be considered frequent.

2. **\(L1\) Itemsets**: These are single items that meet the minimum support threshold on the first pass of the algorithm.

3. **\(C2\) Itemsets**: These are combinations of two items generated from \(L1\) itemsets that you need to check in the next round to see if they also meet the support threshold.

### How A-priori Works:

- **Step 1**: Determine the support of each individual item and keep only those that meet a minimum support threshold. These make up the \(L1\) itemsets.

- **Step 2**: Combine \(L1\) itemsets to form \(C2\) itemsets, which are candidate itemsets containing two items.

- **Step 3**: Calculate the support for each candidate itemset in \(C2\) and keep those that meet the threshold, forming \(L2\) itemsets.

### Your Specific Example:

From your information, you have:
- \(L1\) includes itemsets \([0, 0, 1, 0]\) and \([0, 0, 0, 1]\). This means the single items \(f3\) and \(f4\) have sufficient support on their own.

### Generating \(C2\):

- You take each item in \(L1\) and pair them with each other to form \(C2\). Since there are only two items in \(L1\), the only possible combination is \(f3\) and \(f4\) together:

  - \(f3\) is represented as \([0, 0, 1, 0]\)
  - \(f4\) is represented as \([0, 0, 0, 1]\)

- When combined:

  - The binary representation of \(f3\) and \(f4\) together is \([0, 0, 1, 1]\), which means both \(f3\) and \(f4\) are present in the itemset.

## S19, Q16) Consider the observations in Table 4. We consider these as 9-dimensional binary vectors and wish to compute the pairwise similarity. Which of the following statements are true? #jaccard #cosine #smc
