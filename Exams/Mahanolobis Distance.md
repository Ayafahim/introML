## S20, Q23) Consider the dataset given in Figure 9. We will consider the Mahanalobis distance using the empirical covariance matrix estimated based on the 1000 blue  observations. Which one of the following statements is  correct?

As the correlation between x1 and x2 is positive the covariance matrix only has positive  elements. The covariance matrix will have a shape in the direction of the green cirles and blue plusses and therefore these pairs of observations will have relatively short Mahanalobis distance between each other, when compared to the other pairs of observations. Thus, the Mahanalobis distance between the two green circles is smaller than the Mahanalobis distance between the two black squares.
