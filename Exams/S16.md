The matrix `S` is a diagonal matrix containing the singular values of the PCA, and the matrix `V` contains the principal directions (eigenvectors). We have to only look at the mesaurements from start to end which goes from 1 to -3 on the y-axis. The operation `-3v2 - 1v2` (it is -1 because we compute difference) is linear combination of the second column of the `V` matrix, which corresponds to the second principal component. 

```python
import numpy as np  
  
# V matrix from the second image  
V = np.array([  
    [-0.3, -0.5,  0.7,  0.2,  0.2],  
    [-0.4,  0.6, -0.0,  0.2,  0.7],  
    [-0.4, -0.4, -0.7,  0.4, -0.0],  
    [-0.6, -0.1, -0.1, -0.8,  0.1],  
    [-0.5,  0.4,  0.2,  0.2, -0.7]  
])  
  
# Extracting the second principal component (v2)  
v2 = V[:, 1]  # This is the second column of V  
  
# Computing -3v2 - 1v2  
result_vector = -3 * v2 - 1 * v2  
  
# Display the result  
print(result_vector)


#result
#[ 2.  -2.4  1.6  0.4 -1.6]
# 2 = x1, -2.4 = x2, etc...
#If negative coefficent negative impact, otherwise positive impact

# We see the temperature goes up, the humidity drops and the light goes up, therefore option A is correct.

```

#EuclianDistances 
## 4) Consider the distances in Table 2. The  class labels C1, C2 (corresponding to {o1, o2, o3, o4, o5} and {o6, o7, o8, o9}) will be predicted using a k-nearest neighbour classifier based on the distances given in Table 2.Suppose we use leave-one-out cross validation  (i.e. the observation that is being predicted is left out) and a 3-nearest neighbour classifier (i.e. k = 3). What is the error rate computed for all N = 9 observations?

![[Pasted image 20240418203729.png]]

## Solution 
The error rate is `2/9` because we have to find the 3 closest values to the values in first column. if majority of the values/neighbours are in the same class it is the correctly classified otherwise its wrong. 
Consider e.g. $O_1$, its closest neighbours are $O_3, O_5, O_6$  where 2/3 are in same class there for it is correctly classified. Whereas, the closest neighbours are $O_7, O_8, O_3$ where 2/3 are in the other class, therefore it is wrongly classified.


## 5) Consider the distances in Table 2 and  suppose we wish to apply mixture modelling and we use the normal density as the mixture distributions:

$$
p(x | \mu, \sigma) = \mathcal{N}(x; \mu, \sigma) = \left( \frac{1}{(2\pi\sigma^2)^{\frac{M}{2}}} \right) e^{-\frac{\|x-\mu\|^2}{2\sigma^2}}.
$$


![[Pasted image 20240418210105.png]]
## Solution
Options A and B are not properly normalized by the number of mixture components. Option C does not use the squared distances. Accordingly option D is the correct answer.

## 6) What is the a.r.d. of observation o9 using K = 2 nearest neighbours?

We wish to compute the average relative KNN density (a.r.d) of observation $O_9$ from the Occupancy dataset described in Table 1 using the distances given in Table 2. Letting $d(x, y)$ denote the Euclidian distance metric the a.r.d. is defined as:

$$
\text{density}(x, K) = \frac{1}{K} \sum_{y \in N(x, K)} d(\bar{x}, y)
$$

$$
\text{a.r.d}(x, K) = \frac{1}{K} \sum_{z \in N(x, K)} \frac{\text{density}(x, K)}{\text{density}(z, K)},
$$

where \( N(x, K) \) is the set of \( K \)-nearest neighbors of \( x \).

## Solution
The nearest neighbour of $O_9$ is $O_6$, $O_8$ and the nearest neighbours of $O_6$ is $O_2$, $O_9$ and for $O_8$ it is $O_7$, $O_9$. The densities are:
$density(O_9, K = 2) = 0.746268656716$
$density(O_6, K = 2) = 0.505050505051$ 
$density(O_8, K = 2) = 0.724637681159$
so: 

$$
\text{a.r.d}(o_g, K = 2) = \frac{0.7463}{\frac{1}{2}(0.5051 + 0.7246)} = 1.2138
$$

## 7) A hierarchical clustering is applied to the 9 observations in Table 2 using minimum linkage.  Which of the dendrograms shown in Figure 4 corresponds to the clustering? #TODO

![[Pasted image 20240420141416.png]]

### Solution
The correct answer is D, dendrogram 4. $O_8$ and $O_9$ are grouped together in all diagrams. Since the distance from $O_6$ to $O_8$ is lower than the distance from $O_7$ to $O_6$ then $O_6$ should link to $O_8$, $O_9$ before $O_7$. This allows us to rule out dendrogram 1 and dendrogram 2. Finally, $O_3$ and $O_1$ should clearly link together allowing us to rule out dendrogram 3. This leaves only option D.



## 8) What can be concluded about the Cosine similarity of these two observations? (Hint: recall for vectors $x, y$ that $||x - y||^2_2 = ||x||^2_2 + ||y||^2_2 - 2xáµ€y$)

In Table 2 is given the pairwise euclidian distances between 9 observations from the Occupancy dataset of Table 1. Suppose the Euclidian norm of observations o2 and o3 is:

$$||o_2|| = \sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^{M} x_{1k}^2} = 3.04, \quad ||o_3|| = \sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^{M} x_{2k}^2} = 1.5$$


To find the cosine similarity between observations $o_2$ and $o_3$, we can use the relationship given in the hint and the norm of the observations:

$$ ||o_2 - o_3||^2_2 = ||o_2||^2_2 + ||o_3||^2_2 - 2 \cdot o_2^To_3 $$

Cosine similarity is defined as:

$$ \text{cosine similarity} = \frac{o_2^To_3}{||o_2|| \cdot ||o_3||} $$

From the provided hint and equation, we can isolate $o_2^To_3$:

$$ 2 \cdot o_2^To_3 = ||o_2||^2_2 + ||o_3||^2_2 - ||o_2 - o_3||^2_2 $$

Given:

$$ ||o_2|| = 3.04 $$
$$ ||o_3|| = 1.5 $$

And from the Table 2 (not shown in the current context, but given earlier), we know the Euclidean distance between $o_2$ and $o_3$:

$$ ||o_2 - o_3|| = 4.40 $$

Now we calculate:

$$ ||o_2||^2_2 = (3.04)^2 = 9.2416 $$
$$ ||o_3||^2_2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25 $$
$$ ||o_2 - o_3||^2_2 = (4.40)^2 = 19.36 $$

Now we plug these into the equation:

$$ 2 \cdot o_2^To_3 = 9.2416 + 2.25 - 19.36 $$

$$ 2 \cdot o_2^To_3 = 11.4916 - 19.36 $$

$$ 2 \cdot o_2^To_3 = -7.8684 $$

$$ o_2^To_3 = \frac{-7.8684}{2} $$

$$ o_2^To_3 = -3.9342 $$

Then, we calculate the cosine similarity:

$$ \text{cosine similarity} = \frac{-3.9342}{3.04 \cdot 1.5} $$

$$ \text{cosine similarity} = \frac{-3.9342}{4.56} $$

$$ \text{cosine similarity} = -0.8628 $$

Therefore, the correct answer is:

D. cos(o2, o3) â‰ˆ âˆ’0.8628

## 9) What will Huntâ€™s algorithm do if classification error is used as impurity measure?
![[Pasted image 20240420141911.png]]

To determine which split Hunt's algorithm would select, we need to calculate the classification error for each potential split and then choose the split that provides the greatest purity gain \( \Delta \). The classification error for a split is calculated by finding the proportion of the majority class within each partition of the split and then subtracting from 1.

The classification error for each node is:

$$
\text{Classification Error} = 1 - \max\left(\frac{\text{Count of Majority Class}}{\text{Total Count}}\right)
$$

To calculate the purity gain \( \Delta \) for a split, we need to calculate the weighted sum of the classification errors for the child nodes and subtract it from the classification error before the split (the parent node).

The dataset before any splits has 129 observations unoccupied (\( y = 0 \)) and 169 observations occupied (\( y = 1 \)). The classification error of the parent node is:

$$
\text{Parent Error} = 1 - \max\left(\frac{129}{129 + 169}, \frac{169}{129 + 169}\right)
$$

Next, we'll calculate the classification error for each split. Here's how to calculate it for Split 1:

For Split 1:

- Node 1 (Temperature < 20): Classification error is $1 - \frac{45}{45 + 1}$
- Node 2 (20 â‰¤ Temperature â‰¤ 22): Classification error is $1 - \frac{66}{47 + 66}$
- Node 3 (Temperature > 22): Classification error is $1 - \frac{33}{8 + 33}$

We then weigh these classification errors by the number of observations in each node to get the weighted classification error for Split 1. Finally, we do the same calculations for Splits 2 and 3.
