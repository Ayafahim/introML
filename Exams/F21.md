From the histograms, we see that x3 (stearic) has a long right tail. For x8 (eicosenoic) more than a quarter of the observations are close to 0, which means that the first quartile must also be close to 0. Using this knowledge boxplot 2 is matched to x3 (stearic), and boxplot 4 is matched to x8 (eicosenoic).
Also you can see outliers in boxplot 2
## 17) How many parameters has to be trained to fit the neural network? #ANN

An artificial neural network (ANN) trained on the Olive Oil dataset described in Table 1  will be used to predict the region of origin in Italy y as a multi-class classification problem based on all of the attributes x1, . . . , x8. The neural network has a single hidden layer containing nh = 50 units that uses a sigmoid non-linear activation function. The output layer uses a softmax activation function as described in the lecture notes, Section 15.3.2. How many parameters has to be trained to fit the neural network?
### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Architecture Details**:
   - **Input Features (M)**: 8 (x1 through x8)
   - **Hidden Units (nh)**: 50
   - **Output Classes (C)**: 9 (one for each class)

2. **Parameters between Input Layer and Hidden Layer**:
   - Total parameters for the hidden layer = $(M + 1) \times nh = (8 + 1) \times 50 = 9 \times 50 = 450$

3. **Parameters between Hidden Layer and Output Layer**:
   - Total parameters for the output layer = $(nh + 1) \times C = (50 + 1) \times 9 = 51 \times 9 = 459$

4. **Total Parameters in the Network**:
   - Total parameters = $450 + 459 = 909$

### Conclusion:
The total number of parameters that need to be trained in this neural network is $909$.
