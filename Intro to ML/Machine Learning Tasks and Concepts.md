## PCA and Feature Extraction

**What is PCA?**  
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique used to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset while retaining as much information as possible. It works by identifying the directions, called principal components, along which the variance of the data is maximized. This is useful in data preprocessing for analytical modeling and visualizing high-dimensional data.

**How does it work?**  
PCA transforms the original variables to a new set of variables, which are orthogonal (uncorrelated) and ordered so that the first few retain most of the variation present in all of the original variables.

## Similarity and Statistics

**Euclidean and Cosine Similarity:**  
- **Euclidean similarity** measures the straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space.
- **Cosine similarity** measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, used to determine how similar the vectors are regardless of their size.

### Application:
- **Objective:** Calculate these similarities among customers based on their `Spending Score` and `Items Purchased` to understand customer behavior patterns.
- **Statistics:** Use summary statistics to calculate probabilities, such as the likelihood of item returns based on customer purchase behavior.

## Probability Densities and Visualization

**Histograms and KDE Plots:**
- **Histograms** show the frequency distribution of a variable.
- **Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)** provides a smooth estimate of the probability density function of a random variable.

### Application:
- **Objective:** Visualize the distribution of `Session Duration` across different customer ages.
- **Analysis:** Interpret the visual patterns to derive insights about customer engagement.

## Decision Trees and Regression

**Decision Trees:** A model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.
**Linear Regression:** A statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

### Application:
- **Decision Tree:** Predict the `Category` based on various features.
- **Linear Regression:** Model the relationship between `Annual Income` and `Spending Score`.

## Overfitting, Cross-Validation, and Nearest Neighbor

**k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN):** A simple, non-parametric algorithm that uses 'feature similarity' to predict the values of new datapoints based on how closely they match the points in the training set.

### Application:
- **Objective:** Use k-NN to predict `Returned Items` based on `Spending Score` and `Session Duration`.
- **Cross-Validation:** Employ cross-validation techniques to select the optimal number of neighbors (k) and prevent model overfitting.

## Performance Evaluation and Bayes Methods

**Naive Bayes:** A classification technique based on Bayes' Theorem with an assumption of independence among predictors.

### Application:
- **Objective:** Train a Naive Bayes classifier to determine a customer's `Category` from demographic and behavioral data.
- **Evaluation:** Use a confusion matrix, precision, and recall to evaluate the model's performance.

## Neural Networks and Bias/Variance

**Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs):** Computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains.

### Application:
- **Objective:** Classify customers based on loyalty levels derived from `Spending Score`.
- **Bias/Variance Trade-off:** Discuss methods to manage and balance bias and variance within the model to improve accuracy.

## Ensemble Methods and AUC

**Ensemble Methods:** Techniques that create multiple models and then combine them to produce improved results.
**AUC - ROC Curve:** A performance measurement for classification problems at various threshold settings.

### Application:
- **Objective:** Combine models like decision trees, logistic regression, and SVM to predict loyalty levels.
- **AUC Evaluation:** Assess model performance using ROC curves and AUC statistics.

## Clustering

**k-Means Clustering:** A method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters.
**Hierarchical Clustering:** A method of cluster analysis which seeks to build a hierarchy of clusters.

### Application:
- **Objective:** Segment customers based on `Annual Income` and `Spending Score`.
- **Comparison:** Perform both k-means and hierarchical clustering and visually compare the results.

## Mixture Models and Density Estimation

**Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM):** A probabilistic model that assumes all the data points are generated from a mixture of a finite number of Gaussian distributions with unknown parameters.

### Application:
- **Objective:** Model `Spending Score` as a mixture of Gaussian distributions using the EM algorithm to estimate parameters.

## Association Mining

**Association Rule Learning:** A rule-based machine learning method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases.

### Application:
- **Objective:** Identify frequent itemsets and derive association rules in the dataset to discover cross-selling opportunities.
