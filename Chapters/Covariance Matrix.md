#### How to Interpret the Numbers:

Let's apply this understanding to the matrices given in your problem and see how they fit the clusters:

1. **Matrix Σ3 = $\begin{bmatrix} 0.2 & 0.0 \\ 0.0 & 3.5 \end{bmatrix}$**:
   - $\Sigma_{11} = 0.2$: Small variance along the x-axis, meaning the cluster will be narrow horizontally.
   - $\Sigma_{22} = 3.5$: Large variance along the y-axis, meaning the cluster will be much more spread vertically.
   - $\Sigma_{12} = \Sigma_{21} = 0$: No covariance between x and y, so the cluster is aligned with the axes, not tilted.

   **Match**: Perfect for a tall, narrow, vertically aligned cluster like the one on the left in Figure 8.

2. **Matrix Σ2 = $\begin{bmatrix} 1.0 & 0.8 \\ 0.8 & 1.0 \end{bmatrix}$**:
   - $\Sigma_{11} = 1.0$ and $\Sigma_{22} = 1.0$: Similar variance on both x and y axes, indicating a roughly balanced spread in both directions.
   - $\Sigma_{12} = \Sigma_{21} = 0.8$: Significant positive covariance, indicating that as x increases, y also tends to increase. This gives the cluster a tilted orientation from the bottom-left to the top-right.

   **Match**: Ideal for a cluster that stretches diagonally across the plot, like the top-right cluster in Figure 8.
