These notes have been made for the course 02450 Introduction to Machine Learning. I have created these notes with the intention of being able to pass the exam without having been to a single lecture myself🥸

Folders:
- Chapters
	Includes theoretical explanations of each chapter in the book. These also include some examples from exam problems or book problems and base knowledge. Refer to this if stuck on a problem that does not have a similar counterpart in earlier exams. Can also include scripts.
- Exams
	A collection of all earlier exam solutions from 2016-2023, grouped by subject. They also contain code scripts used. 
- Images
	Collection of all the images in the notes.
