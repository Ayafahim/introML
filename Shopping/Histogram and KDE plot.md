### How to Interpret Patterns:

- Look for peaks in the KDE plots, as they represent the most common session durations within each age group.
- Compare the spread (width) of the distributions; a wider distribution suggests more variability in session duration within that age group.
- Overlapping distributions indicate similar behaviors across different age groups, whereas distinct non-overlapping areas suggest age-specific patterns.
- Any skewness in the distribution could indicate a tendency for a particular age group to have shorter or longer sessions.


### Interpretations:

- **Short Sessions in Younger Age Groups**: Younger customers (18-29) appear to favor quick browsing sessions, which may reflect a more goal-oriented or less patient browsing behavior.
- **Middle-Aged Engagement**: Customers aged 30-49 show a tendency for longer sessions, which could indicate more engagement or interest in browsing more content or products.
- **Variability Among Older Age Groups**: The 50-59 age group shows a wide range of session durations, suggesting diverse browsing behaviors. It might indicate a segment with varied interests or use cases for the website.
- **Consistency in Older Customers**: The 60-69 age group seems to have a common session duration around 30 minutes, suggesting a possible routine or consistent use pattern.

### Business Insights:

- **Targeted User Experience**: The website could tailor the user experience based on these behaviors, such as faster checkouts for younger users and more engaging content for middle-aged users.
- **Marketing Strategies**: Marketing campaigns could be designed with these browsing behaviors in mind, such as quick offers for the younger demographic and more detailed information for customers in the 50-59 age group.
- **Product Placement**: For age groups with longer session durations, strategically placed products and offers might be effective, whereas for groups with shorter sessions, a more direct and visible approach could be better.
